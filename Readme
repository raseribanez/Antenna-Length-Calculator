Designed to be a simple tool for general antenna design across a wide rabge of frequencies.
A follow up version for each one will be compiled as .exe files - to cater for non-linux and non-python systems 
(Windows users without Python installed.

There are seperate versions for 1/4, 1/2, 5/8, and Full Loop.

You simply enter your desired frequency and the vertical wavelength by clicking either "Meters" or "Feet", depending on what
yourpreferences are. If you have a frequency range or band you wish to use, I would take the lowest frequency and highest frequency
for the range you want, and work out the average / mid-way point, then make adjustments from there.

NOTE this is just to get an idea of the wavelengths for specific frequencies - if used for Antenna design, you should know
that different frequencies(wavelengths) have different antenna systems that work better on some than others, 
e.g: I would make a dipole for the 1/2 wavelength at CB frequencies around 27 MHz, and use it as a vertical dipoole, 
not horizontal. 

If I used this calculator to find out the 1/2 wavelength of 27MHz, the result would then be spilt into 2 (halfed), the top section
would be my radiating element, and the lower half would be my ground (ground/lower element is connected to the braided/shielded outer COAX)



You will need Python 2 Installed to run these versions. 
Written on 2.7.9, also runs ok on 2.7.11.

The calculations used in the programs are below:


Antenna Calculations:

585 / MHz = feet (for 5/8)
468 / MHz = feet (for 1/2)
234 / MHz = feet (for 1/4)
1005 / MHz = feet (for full loop)


Feet to meters calculation

feet / 3.28 = meters
feet x 0.3048 = meters
