Designed to be a simple tool for general antenna design across a wide rabge of frequencies.
A follow up version for each one will be compiled as .exe files - to cater for non-linux and non-python systems 
(Windows users without Python installed

163-CT-160 - Charlie Tango
163-DR-663 - Delta Romeo

You will need Python 2 Installed to run these versions (written on 2.7.9)

Antenna Calculations

585 / MHz (feet) for 5/8
468 / MHz (feet) for 1/2
234 / MHz (feet) for 1/4
1005 / MHz (feet) for full loop

Feet to meters calculation

feet / 3.28 = meters
feet x 0.3048 = meters
